        <p>There are many cultures around the world that have and follow their own calendars, which is exactly not the same as the Western Gregorian calendar.
             However, despite that, they abide by the rule of 12 months a year. An Ethiopian year is comprised of 13 months, and is seven years 
             behind the Gregorian calendar. In fact, Ethiopians celebrated the new millennium on September 11, 2007; this is because 
             the Ethiopians continued with the same calendar that the Roman church amended in 525 AD.</p>
