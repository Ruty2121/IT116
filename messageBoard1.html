    <p>With the victory at the Battle of Adwa in hand and the Italian colonial army destroyed,

       Eritrea was King Menelikâ€™s for the taking but no order to occupy was given.
       It seems that Menelik II was wiser than the Europeans had given him credit for.
       Realizing they would bring all their force to bear on his country if he attacked,
      he instead sought to restore the peace that had been broken by the Italians and their treaty manipulation seven years before.
      In signing the treaty, Menelik II again proved his adeptness at politics as he promised each nation something for
       what they gave and made sure each would benefit his country and not a rival nation.
